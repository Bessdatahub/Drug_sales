The first dashboard focuses on the sales analysis for 2022-2023. Based on my analysis, certain months experienced growth while others did not. Overall, there has been an increase in revenue from 2022 to 2023. The top 7 performing drugs based on total revenue are Doxycycline, Ergocalciferol, Lisinopril, Clonazepam, Ezetimibe, Valacyclovir, and Albuterol. The 7 underperforming drugs are Hydrochlorothiazide, Fluticasone, Metformin, Prednisone, Amoxicillin, Montelukast, and Warfarin.

The second dashboard focuses on customer analysis. There are 200 customers from 6 different countries: Canada, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Canada and Australia contribute the most revenue, making up 66.0% of the total.

A significant portion of the revenue, 69%, comes from customers in the age groups 51 and above and 31-40.

Customers are categorized as either buyers or sellers. Those who buy the drugs for personal use contribute approximately $7.91 million in revenue, while customers who are sellers contribute $56.76 million in revenue.

The third dashboard focuses on trend analysis. The total number of transactions from 2022-2023 was approximately 12,000. There has been an overall increase in revenue from 2022 to 2023, with a consistent increase across quarters 1 to 4. However, there have also been both upward and downward trends in monthly revenue throughout this period.
